    2. INSIGHT: Use this if the query requires finding conceptual relationships, trends, contextual explanations, or reading specific notes (e.g., "Why did region X fail?", "What do customers think about product Y?").
    3. HYBRID: Use this if the query requires filtering by specific IDs or categories first, and then finding semantic context (e.g., "Summarize the complaints for our top 5 most expensive products").
